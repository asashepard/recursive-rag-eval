# Source list for this experiment's corpus.
#
# Where these came from:
# - Publicly accessible regulatory documents (state PUC orders/rules, ERCOT market rules,
#   NERC standards, DOE-417 materials) gathered manually during corpus assembly.
# - The NARUC index URL is included as a public “directory” reference that helps justify
#   the particular state set chosen for this controlled experiment.
#
# How they were chosen:
# - One primary-source “anchor” per jurisdiction for incident reporting / cyber reporting
#   obligations, plus a federal/bulk-power layer (NERC/DOE).
# - Chosen to be stable, citable URLs and to cover a small but diverse set of jurisdictions.
#
# Reproducibility:
# - Use `python download_sources.py` (or `python build_corpus.py --download`) to re-download
#   these sources into downloads/ and regenerate downloads/_download-log.csv.
